# Webdriver
Project created with the help of OpenAI Codex. Code refurbished and reassembled by me.

## Dependencies
This was written in Java 19, I guess any new version will work. This also requires FFMPEG to be installed and added to the PATH variable. It only works on Windows as far as I'm aware.

## Instructions
Compile and place the script in a folder. Upon execution it will create a subfolder and generate 15 videos depicting random shaped, colored, positioned and sized rectangles. Basically like Webdriver Torso, but a bit more abstract.
It will also generate imageX.png files in the same directory as the program. They are safe to remove when the script has finished.
I want to make it more configurable and add sound beeps in the future.
